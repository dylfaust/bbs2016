			Strategy-On-The-Go
		</h1>
		<p style = "margin-top: 10px;">
		The hard work doesn’t stop once you have deployed your awesome marketing strategy. Rather, this is where the hard work begins. Marketing strategies need to be treated like business plans in that they are always evolving. Once launched, your marketing campaign needs to be under constant scrutiny and measured every way it can to ensure what you thought worked yesterday is still effective today. This is why we enlist Strategy-On-The-Go. It makes sure your marketing strategy and message never grow stale or become inefective. We constantly massage what works and tweak or illiminating what doesn’t.
