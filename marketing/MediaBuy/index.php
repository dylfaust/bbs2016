						Creating a Media Buy Plan
					</h1>
					<p>
					Buzzbizz Studios offers a unique blend of science, awareness, and gut when creating result-oriented media buying strategies for your company. Itâ€™s important to start with the study of microeconomics, couple it with a firm grasp of socioeconomics, and demographic segmentation. Then we pair what the science tells us with an awareness of our community. Top it all off with a touch of gut and you end up with intuitive buying strategies as unique as the companies they are engineered for.
