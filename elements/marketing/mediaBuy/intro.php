				Media Buying
			</h3>
			<p>It takes very little talent to purchase advertisement in a small market like Alaska. The challenge is to buy media effectively with purpose and profitable potential for the client. Media buying strategies vary depending on what type of media is being bought, what company it is being bought for, the budget the company is working with, and the goals that are trying to be obtained.
			<br><br>
Finding the right media mix for each client is something Buzzbizz Studios has mastered over the last 10 years. No matter how large or small your budget, you can trust that we will maximize your exposure.
