				Fundraising
			</h3>
			<p>Non-profits have unique challenges compared to for-profit organizations. In a simplified aspect, they have all the challenges as a for-profit company with the added struggle to get people to hand over hard earned money for little more than a thank you and a warm feeling in their heart in return. Your cause is important to your clients who count on you to bring relief to their situation â€“ so fundraising is imperative to your success.</p>
